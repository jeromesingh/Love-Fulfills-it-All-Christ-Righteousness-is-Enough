  <p class="text">God has given us a standard of righteousness
</p>

  <p class="bible">James 2:12 KJV  So speak ye, and so do, as they that shall be judged by the law of liberty.
  </p>

  <p class="bible">2 Corinthians 5:10 KJV  For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every one may receive the things
  done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad.
</p>

  <p class="bible" >Exodus 31:18 KJV  And he gave unto Moses, when he had made an end of communing with him upon mount Sinai, two tables of
  testimony, tables of stone, written with the finger of God.
</p>

<p class="bible">Psalms 40:6-8 KJV  Sacrifice and offering thou didst not desire; mine ears hast thou opened: burnt offering and sin
offering hast thou not required.  (7)  Then said I, Lo, I come: in the volume of the book it is written of me,  (8)  I
delight to do thy will, O my God: yea, thy law is within my heart.

</p>

<p class="bible">Matthew 5:21-22 KJV  Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not kill; and whosoever shall kill
shall be in danger of the judgment:  (22)  But I say unto you, That whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause
shall be in danger of the judgment: and whosoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be in danger of the council: but
whosoever shall say, Thou fool, shall be in danger of hell fire.

  </p>

<p class="text" >Jesus is fulfilling the law

</p>

<p class="bible">Matthew 5:17 KJV  Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil.

</p>

<p class="bible">1 Thessalonians 5:22-23 KJV  Abstain from all appearance of evil.  (23)  And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly;
and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.

</p>

<p class="bible">Romans 7:7 KJV  What shall we say then? Is the law sin? God forbid. Nay, I had not known sin, but by the law: for I had
not known lust, except the law had said, Thou shalt not covet.

</p>

<p class="bible">John 16:8 KJV  And when he is come, he will reprove the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment:

</p>

<p class="bible">1 John 1:9 KJV  If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all
unrighteousness.

</p>

<p class="bible">Romans 7:12-13 KJV  Wherefore the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good.  (13)  Was then that which
is good made death unto me? God forbid. But sin, that it might appear sin, working death in me by that which is good;
that sin by the commandment might become exceeding sinful.

</p>

<h5>So what's the problem? 
  Answer: <b>Sin</b>
</h5>

<p class="bible">John 1:51 KJV  And he saith unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Hereafter ye shall see heaven open, and the angels
of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man.

</p>

<p class="bible">Romans 7:14-24 KJV  For we know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold under sin.  (15)  For that which I do I
allow not: for what I would, that do I not; but what I hate, that do I.  (16)  If then I do that which I would not, I
consent unto the law that it is good.  (17)  Now then it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me.  (18) 
For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh,) dwelleth no good thing: for to will is present with me; but how to perform
that which is good I find not.  (19)  For the good that I would I do not: but the evil which I would not, that I do.
 (20)  Now if I do that I would not, it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me.  (21)  I find then a law,
that, when I would do good, evil is present with me.  (22)  For I delight in the law of God after the inward man:  (23) 
But I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of
sin which is in my members.  (24)  O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death?

</p>

<p class="bible">Romans 8:1-2 KJV  There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the
flesh, but after the Spirit.  (2)  For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of
sin and death.

</p>

<p class="bible">Galatians 5:19 KJV  Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these; Adultery, fornication, uncleanness,
lasciviousness,

</p>

<p class="bible">Romans 6:23 KJV  For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.

</p>

<p class="bible">Romans 6:3-4 KJV  Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death?  (4) 
Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of
the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.

</p>

<p class="bible">Matthew 5:17-18 KJV  Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to
fulfil.  (18)  For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from
the law, till all be fulfilled.

</p>

<h5>Blotting out of handwriting</h5>

<p class="bible">Colossians 2:14 KJV  Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us, and took
it out of the way, nailing it to his cross;

</p>

<h5>Handwriting of Ordinances</h5>

<p class="bible">Ephesians 2:15 KJV  Having abolished in his flesh the enmity, even the law of commandments contained in ordinances; for
to make in himself of twain one new man, so making peace;

</p>

<p class="bible">Exodus 12:43 KJV  And the LORD said unto Moses and Aaron, This is the ordinance of the passover: There shall no stranger
eat thereof:

</p>

<p class="bible">1 Corinthians 5:7 KJV  Purge out therefore the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, as ye are unleavened. For even
Christ our passover is sacrificed for us:

</p>

<p class="bible">Deuteronomy 31:24-26 KJV  And it came to pass, when Moses had made an end of writing the words of this law in a book,
until they were finished,  (25)  That Moses commanded the Levites, which bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD,
saying,  (26)  Take this book of the law, and put it in the side of the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God, that
it may be there for a witness against thee.

</p>

<p class="bible">Acts 15:3-10 KJV  And being brought on their way by the church, they passed through Phenice and Samaria, declaring the
conversion of the Gentiles: and they caused great joy unto all the brethren.  (4)  And when they were come to Jerusalem,
they were received of the church, and of the apostles and elders, and they declared all things that God had done with
them.  (5)  But there rose up certain of the sect of the Pharisees which believed, saying, That it was needful to
circumcise them, and to command them to keep the law of Moses.  (6)  And the apostles and elders came together for to
consider of this matter.  (7)  And when there had been much disputing, Peter rose up, and said unto them, Men and
brethren, ye know how that a good while ago God made choice among us, that the Gentiles by my mouth should hear the word
of the gospel, and believe.  (8)  And God, which knoweth the hearts, bare them witness, giving them the Holy Ghost, even
as he did unto us;  (9)  And put no difference between us and them, purifying their hearts by faith.  (10)  Now
therefore why tempt ye God, to put a yoke upon the neck of the disciples, which neither our fathers nor we were able to
bear?

</p>

<h5>Shadow of things to come</h5>

<p class="bible">Colossians 2:15-17 KJV  And having spoiled principalities and powers, he made a shew of them openly, triumphing over
them in it.  (16)  Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of an holyday, or of the new moon,
or of the sabbath days:  (17)  Which are a shadow of things to come; but the body is of Christ.

</p>

<p class="bible">Matthew 27:50-53 KJV  Jesus, when he had cried again with a loud voice, yielded up the ghost.  (51)  And, behold, the
veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom; and the earth did quake, and the rocks rent;  (52)  And
the graves were opened; and many bodies of the saints which slept arose,  (53)  And came out of the graves after his
resurrection, and went into the holy city, and appeared unto many.

</p>

<p class="bible">Ephesians 4:8 KJV  Wherefore he saith, When he ascended up on high, he led captivity captive, and gave gifts unto men.

</p>

<p class="bible">Leviticus 23:37-39 KJV  These are the feasts of the LORD, which ye shall proclaim to be holy convocations, to offer an
offering made by fire unto the LORD, a burnt offering, and a meat offering, a sacrifice, and drink offerings, every
thing upon his day:  (38)  Beside the sabbaths of the LORD, and beside your gifts, and beside all your vows, and beside
all your freewill offerings, which ye give unto the LORD.  (39)  Also in the fifteenth day of the seventh month, when ye
have gathered in the fruit of the land, ye shall keep a feast unto the LORD seven days: on the first day shall be a
sabbath, and on the eighth day shall be a sabbath.

</p>

<p class="bible">Hebrews 10:1-4 KJV  For the law having a shadow of good things to come, and not the very image of the things, can never
with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers thereunto perfect.  (2)  For then
would they not have ceased to be offered? because that the worshippers once purged should have had no more conscience of
sins.  (3)  But in those sacrifices there is a remembrance again made of sins every year.  (4)  For it is not possible
that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins.

</p>

<p class="bible">Hebrews 4:14-16 KJV  Seeing then that we have a great high priest, that is passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of
God, let us hold fast our profession.  (15)  For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of
our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin.  (16)  Let us therefore come boldly unto
the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.

</p>

<p class="bible">Hebrews 2:17-18 KJV  Wherefore in all things it behoved him to be made like unto his brethren, that he might be a
merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God, to make reconciliation for the sins of the people.  (18) 
For in that he himself hath suffered being tempted, he is able to succour them that are tempted.

</p>

<p class="bible">Galatians 5:16-21 KJV  This I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh.  (17)  For
the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh: and these are contrary the one to the other: so
that ye cannot do the things that ye would.  (18)  But if ye be led of the Spirit, ye are not under the law.  (19)  Now
the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these; Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness,  (20) 
Idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies,  (21)  Envyings, murders,
drunkenness, revellings, and such like: of the which I tell you before, as I have also told you in time past, that they
which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God.

</p>

<p class="bible">1 Corinthians 6:9-11 KJV  Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived:
neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind,  (10)  Nor
thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God.  (11)  And such
were some of you: but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by
the Spirit of our God.
